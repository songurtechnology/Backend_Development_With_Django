## Introduction to Django

Django is a high-level, open-source Python web framework known for its rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It encourages the development of web applications with reusable code and a "batteries-included" philosophy. Whether you want to build a simple blog or a complex web application, Django empowers you to do it efficiently and with best practices.

## Project Overview

This project serves as your starting point for learning Django. It provides an overview of the Django framework, its features, and sets you up with a sample project. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of Django's core concepts, and you'll be ready to create your web applications.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with Django, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/introduction-to-django.git


*** Install Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website. ***

*** Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended): It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Django projects to isolate dependencies. Create one using the following commands: ***

# On Windows
`python -m venv venv`

# On macOS and Linux
`python3 -m venv venv`

Activate the virtual environment:

# On Windows
`venv\Scripts\activate`

# On macOS and Linux
`source venv/bin/activate`

*** Install Django: With your virtual environment activated, install Django: ***

pip install django

*** Run the Project: Navigate to the project directory and start the Django development server: ***

`cd introduction-to-django`
`python manage.py runserver`

*** Access the Project: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/ to access the sample Django project. ***
